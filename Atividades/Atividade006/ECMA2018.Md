### ECMAScript 2018

The JavaScript naming convention started with ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5 and ES6.

But, ECMAScript 2016 and 2017 was not called ES7 and ES8.

Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).

New Features in ECMAScript 2018
This chapter introduces the new features in ECMAScript 2018:

Asynchronous Iteration
Promise Finally
Object Rest Properties
New RegExp Features
JavaScript Asynchronous Iteration
ECMAScript 2018 added asynchronous iterators and iterables.

With asynchronous iterables, we can use the await keyword in for/of loops.

Example
for await () {}
Firefox and Safari were the first browsers with support for JavaScript asynchronous iteration:

Chrome 63	Edge 79	Firefox 57	Safari 11	Opera 50
Dec 2017	Jan 2020	Nov 2017	Sep 2017	Jan 2018

JavaScript Promise.finally

ECMAScript 2018 finalizes the full implementation of the Promise object with Promise.finally:

Example

let myPromise = new Promise();

myPromise.then();
myPromise.catch();
myPromise.finally();
