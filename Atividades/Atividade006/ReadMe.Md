### JavaScript Versions

**JavaScript** was invented by **Brendan Eich** in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

**ECMAScript** is the official name of the language.

**ECMAScript** versions have been abbreviated to **ES1**, **ES2**, **ES3**, **ES5**, and **ES6**.

Since 2016 new versions are named by year (**ECMAScript** 2016 / 2017 / 2018).
