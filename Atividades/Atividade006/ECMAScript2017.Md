### ECMAScript 2017

The JavaScript naming convention started with ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5 and ES6.

But, ECMAScript 2016 and 2017 was not called ES7 and ES8.

Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).

New Features in ECMAScript 2017
This chapter introduces the new features in ECMAScript 2017:

JavaScript String padding
JavaScript Object.entries
JavaScript Object.values
JavaScript async functions
JavaScript shared memory
JavaScript String Padding
ECMAScript 2017 added two String methods: padStart and padEnd to support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string.

Example

let str = "5";
str = str.padStart(4,0);
// result is 0005

Example
let str = "5";
str = str.padEnd(4,0);
// result is 5000
