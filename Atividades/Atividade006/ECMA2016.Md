### ECMAScript 2016

The JavaScript naming convention started with ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5 and ES6.

But, ECMAScript 2016 and 2017 was not called ES7 and ES8.

Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).

New Features in ECMAScript 2016
This chapter introduces the new features in ECMAScript 2016:

JavaScript Exponentiation (**)
JavaScript Exponentiation assignment (**=)
JavaScript Array.prototype.includes
Exponentiation Operator
The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

Example

let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2;          // result is 25
x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x, y):

Example

let x = 5;
let z = Math.pow(x,2);   // result is 25

Exponentiation Assignment

The exponentiation assignment operator (**=) raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.

Example
let x = 5;
x **= 2; // result 25
